# OS-Simulator
Developed as a coursework project. Basically, a website with simulations for different OS concepts.

## Running the Website
### Setting Up
- `cd` into `app`
- Execute `python -m venv venv` to setup a virtual environment
- Start the virtual environment by executing `venv/Scripts/activate`
- Install pip dependencies using `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`
### Running
- `cd` into `app`
- Start the virtual environment by executing `venv/Scripts/activate`
- Execute `flask run`
- Open `localhost:5000` in your browser (the port may be different for your system)
